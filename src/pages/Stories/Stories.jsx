                                Initially, the intention to open a drawing-room came from the fact that I wanted to have a "place to go" to meet and share watercolors with everyone.
                                Because 7 years ago, when I practiced watercolor, I found a very good balance of mind before everything, felt rich in energy and had a lot of love for life.
                                "Nowadays, we are all worried and stressed after working hours, it is extremely necessary to relieve anxiety for a long time. If everyone can find the same love and passion as me back then, Or simply really "standing still" for a few hours, drawing the first pictures with the first emotions is very meaningful. I really thought so.
                                Life is finite, but joy and happiness are infinite things, no matter what time we can find it again, with all that has been and is happening. 🖤

                    feedback, with the experiences when going through the first
                    sessions with everyone.
                    <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, the
                    intention to open a drawing-room came from the fact that I
                    wanted to have a "place to go" to meet and share watercolors
                    with everyone. Because 7 years ago, when I practiced
                    watercolor, I found a very good balance of mind before
                    everything, felt rich in energy and had a lot of love for
                    life.

                    {/* "Nowadays, we are all worried and stressed after working hours, it is extremely necessary to relieve anxiety for a long time. If everyone can find the same love and passion as me back then, Or simply really "standing still" for a few hours, drawing the first pictures with the first emotions is very meaningful. I really thought so.
                                    <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Life is finite, but joy and happiness are infinite things, no matter what time we can find it again, with all that has been and is happening. 🖤
